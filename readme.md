## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone hhttps://github.com/akashverma0786/sorting-visualizer.git

python3 -m venv myenv

# For virtualenv
virtualenv myenv

Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
myenv\Scripts\activate

On macOS and Linux:
source myenv/bin/activate

##### 3. Install Requirements
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies from the requirements.txt file:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Project
after activating virtual environment run sorting.py

5.. Deactivate the Virtual Environment
After you're done working on the project, deactivate the virtual environment:
deactivate
